SQL- structured query language
Relational database (RDBMS)
Pre defined schema in the form of table
table based database
good for complex queries
not a bbest fit for hierarchical storage
Does not vary from database to database
best fit for transactional type application.
excellent community support
vertically scalable- increase ram,cpu on single server
example - Oracle,Mysql,postgresql,sqlite,sql server


NOSQL
Non relational database
dynamic schema
document based database,key value based database ,graph based database ,width column based database 
not a good fit for complex queries
fit better for hierarchical storage as compared to SQL.it uses key value pair way of storing data.
unstructured query language vary from database to database
only limited community support is provided.
horizontal scalable- adding more server into cluster of servers.
example - mongoDB,HBase redis,Cassandra

MySQL - mysql is an open source relational(store data in the form of tables) database management system that  work on many platforms.it provides multi user access to support many storage engines.
high availability
ease of management
secure data protection
scalability and flexibility
high performance 


mongoDB
it is a non relational database which stores data as documents in a binary presentation called BSON (Binary JSON).This kind of database stores related information together for fast query access through the mongoDB query language.
document based database

features
indexing index created to improve the performance
replication
ad-hoc queries
schemaless -it is written in C++
sharding- deployment with large data set and high throughput
